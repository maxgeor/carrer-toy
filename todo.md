# Requirements
- Should be able to see every insight's sources (so you can see the connections between your insights and stories)
  - if the system tells you "this is something I noticed about you", people should be able to understand how it came to that. Some people aren't aware of the observations people make that lead them to percieve you in a certain way.

# Tasks
- Run job titles thorugh ChatGPT to collapse slight job variations (Assistant Teacher -> Teacher)
- Schema design
- Set up DB to:
  - make job table
  - make insight table 
    - has many jobs and insights
- Figure out if/where/how to authenticate people before starting the game
  - Give them the option to test it out w/o auth or to authenticate
  - Where to let people manage auth on ui
- Program in how to handle a new insight  
  - Treat every insight as distinct?
  - Make background prompt that does something like "I'd prefer to do X job over Y job because Z"
  - Take reason and turn it into a list of insights
  - Do a check to see how much a new reason relates to an insight before changing it
    - Not every insight should be modified every time you give a new reason, because the reason could be unrelated to a past insight
  - What if we just blew away all the insights and built them back up each time?
- What would it take to tie an insight back to it's sources?
  - Show the job would you rather + reason
  - Show the previous insight that most related to 
- How to show insight's sources
- How/when to show insights?
- How to toggle insight's visibility
- How to keep the insight schema flexible enough so I can add other games and keep the same backend insight model?
  - Different `types` of insights
  - Each insight is one sentence
  - Insights are chattable
    - You can talk back to the system if an insight doesn't sit right with you.
- How to remember which jobs someone already interacted with
  - Make a decision model?
    - Jobs
    - Picked job
    - Reason
  - Maybe you make a different model for the outcome of each game, which is then used to make an insight
  - Feels a little complicated
